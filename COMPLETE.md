## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Why does it take 1-2 seconds to load?
**A:** The page fetches your repositories from GitHub API. This is normal. First load is slowest; subsequent loads are instant.

### Q: What if I have no public repositories?
**A:** The website shows a friendly error message. Make some GitHub repos public and refresh!

### Q: Can I customize the colors?
**A:** Yes! Edit `styles.css` line 6 to change the accent color. All colors are in `:root` section.

### Q: How do I add my own repositories?
**A:** They're added automatically! Push a repo to GitHub and make it public. It appears in 1-2 seconds on your portfolio.

### Q: Can I show private repositories?
**A:** Yes, but requires GitHub authentication. See `README.md` for instructions.

### Q: How many repositories can it display?
**A:** Currently up to 100. Can be increased with pagination (see Enhancement Ideas in README).

### Q: Is it mobile-friendly?
**A:** Completely! Tested and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## 🎓 INTERVIEW PREPARATION

### 30-Second Pitch
"I built a GitHub portfolio website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It automatically fetches and displays all my public repositories in a responsive grid with a professional dark theme. No frameworks—just pure web technologies."

### Key Points to Discuss
1. **Why vanilla?** "Better performance, demonstrates fundamentals, easier to explain"
2. **Responsive design?** "CSS Grid with auto-fill, media queries for mobile"
3. **API integration?** "GitHub REST API, async/await, error handling"
4. **Architecture?** "Clean separation of HTML/CSS/JS, DRY principles"

### Questions You'll Face
- "Walk me through what happens when someone opens your site"
- "How does the responsive design work?"
- "Why did you choose X technology?"
- "What would you improve?"
- "Can you explain this code?"

**See INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md for detailed answers!**
